# GRASS GIS + Google Earth Engine â†’ SWMM Pipeline (Demo)

This is a **minimal working example** of a reproducible geospatial workflow.
It simulates:
- Retrieving mock rainfall raster from Google Earth Engine
- Extracting land cover statistics using GRASS GIS (mocked)
- Preparing a SWMM input file
- Running a simple hydrologic simulation and plotting a hydrograph

All data and processing here are **illustrative only**.
